# BST 270: Individual Project

This repository contains my attempt to reproduce tables/figures from FiveThirtyEight's [Higher Rates Of Hate Crimes Are Tied To Income Inequality](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/higher-rates-of-hate-crimes-are-tied-to-income-inequality/).

## Environment

This project utilizes the R programming language. Package management is handled through CRAN and should work on various versions of R. For exact package versions used to build this reproduction, create a [Conda](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html#using-conda) environment using the provided `environment.yml` file:

```{bash}
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Project Structure

A complete code reproduction attempt is available at `./code/hate_crimes_reproduction.qmd`. This notebook utilize [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and can be compiled via the command line and/or various IDEs/text editors (e.g. RStudio, VSCode, Jupyter, Neovim, Emacs). Refer to Quarto's [Get Started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) and [Using R](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html) documentation pages for more information. Quarto documents can also be compiled into multiple different file formats -- the repository also contains HTML, PDF, Tex, and Markdown files.

An image of the original plots is also provided in the `./data` directory.

### Getting Started

1.  Clone the GitHub repository.
2.  Open the `hate_crimes_reproduction.qmd` file in R Studio (pre-requisite: install `usmap` and `ggplot2` R packages).
3.  Click "Preview" or "Run" to execute the notebook.

## Data

The data set used for the reproduction analysis is available at `./data/hate_crimes.csv`. It is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/hate-crimes).

The following command can also be utilized to obtain the data via command line:

```{bash}
wget -P data https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/hate-crimes/hate_crimes.csv
```
