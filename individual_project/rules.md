# Individual project

For the BST270 individual project you need to reproduce 2 tables/figures
from a NYT/FiveThirtyEight article. You have to write a "reproducible"
workflow detailing what you did, how you did it, why, where the data
is... The project should be shared on GitHub with appropriate
documentation.

Send an email to Viola and Raphael by **Monday January 22nd** with the
name of the repo.

## Choice of article

Choose one of the articles from FiveThirtyEight
(<https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/>) or the NYT
(<https://github.com/nytimes>) that: 1. Have public data available 2.
Have at least two figures\* (two figures/two tables/one table and one
figure) shown in the main text

The topic is not relevant, as long as it is something you care about or
find interesting.

## Reproduce the figures

### Minimal requirements

-   Project in a GitHub repo accessible to teaching team (either public
    repo or private repo made accessible to Viola and Raphael).
-   GitHub repo needs to be have a README file that briefly explains the
    goal of the project, where to find the files, how to proceed to
    reproduce the results.
-   Submit at least one Rmarkdown notebook that knits and that is well
    documented, with task and goals explained, project structure
    detailed.
-   Project needs to be self-contained and people should be able to
    reproduce your results by following your instructions/code.
-   Code needs to be well commented
-   Data correctly stored or referenced (don't forget to check if you
    can share the data)
-   Data pre-processing adequately commented
-   **If you are unable to exactly replicate the figures it is OK. Just
    write down an explanation on why that is the case**

### Extras

We recommend using a notebook such that you can include comments and
show external figures where necessary. However, any effort is
appreciated, as long as we can reproduce it. **Apply any trick you
learnt during this course or outside**.

As long as we are able to reproduce your figures and tables: - Python is
OK - Workflow management systems are OK - Quarto projects are OK - ... -
200 C++ functions properly compiling and well documented, with a
complete description of the project are OK (but please don't do it :) )
